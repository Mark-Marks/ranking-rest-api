# RANKING REST API

The ranking rest API is a simple rest API built on express which uses noblox.js, for a very simple endpoint you can setup for ranking players on your Roblox group (and many more!). It's very easy to set up, with included comments in order to let you understand it better. It's also separated into multiple URIs, so you do not hoard everything in one simple URL. Enjoy using it!
